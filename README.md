Liquid JSON
===

Rapid prototype/proof of concept to:
* poll an API endpoint for some JSON resource,
* take that resource and create a clickable HTML table out of it
* allow users to click on key-value pairs and assign them to variables
* write a markdown document using those variables surrounded by moustaches "{{}}"
* generate an embeddable link for them to paste one-line of HTML in their webpage
* that embedded HTML generates the content they wanted to retrieve dynamically
